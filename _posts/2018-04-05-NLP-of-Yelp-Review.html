<p>Yelp was founded in 2004 and has become one of the must-have applications. People use Yelp to find local businesses like restaurants, hair stylists, even hospitals. Yelp does not stop at providing business information, it lets people write their experiences from businesses. People rate their experiences by stars and share their opinions with other people. By these stars and reviews, many people decide to visit their trips to these businesses and local business owners look these reviews carefully.</p> 
<p>In this project, I want to build a model to predict stars of reviews whether the user gives 1, which is the lowest, or 5, which is the highest, based on their reviews. It may help to predict business ratings to improve small businesses.</p>
<p>I will use <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013#description" >Yelp Business Rating Prediction from Kaggle</a>. This data is over 10,000 businesses, 8,000 check-in sites, 40,000 users, and 200,000 reviews from the Phoenix, AZ metropolitan area.</p>
