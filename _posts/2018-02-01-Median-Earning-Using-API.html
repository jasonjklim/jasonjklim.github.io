<p>"Go to college, get a better job." People have believed this quote for a long time. Yet, is this still true in today's world? Can we say that going to college would guarantee a better job? Sadly, we all know that that quote would not affect our world. Degrees from college are varied, complex, and often ignored. Although a bachelor's degree is still a big part, where and which field of the degree becomes more important than the degree itself. </p>

<p>First, I must ask one question. "What's a better job?" This can be a very personal question, but in general, we determine this question by future earnings. Salary! In this post, I assemble a dataset for investigating colleges and universities.  Fortunately, there is a large collection of higher education data from the government that is accessible through an API. I use <a href="https://api.data.gov/" >Data.gov</a> to get this data.</p>


<h2 class="section-heading">API</h2>

<p>I want to see median earning after 6 years after college entry. This can mean that how much is starting median earning after college. I use API data of 'College ScoreCard Data' from US Department of Education. The most recent data is 2012 data. Therefore, I scrap 2012 median earning and 2006 college data. For college data, there are two categories; type and majors.</p>

<p>Type is the basic information of the school such as state, size, highest degree, etc.. Major is an academic major that the student commits such as computer, health, etc.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">EDA</h2>

<p>First, I make a plot to see the distribution of median earning of all school after 6 years of graduation.There are some outliers on median earning,  most of the median earning belong between $ 15,000 and $ 70,000. </p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/image/me_api/me_type.png" alt="Median earning by degree types" width="800" height="600">
<p>Then, which degree is worth? In this data, there are four types of degrees; certificate, associate, bachelor, and graduate. Even though there are many outliers, graduate degree school has more median earning than other degrees. Surprisingly, median earning differences between certificate, associate, and bachelors are less than $ 20,000. </p>

<p>I use another feature from data, Carnegie Classification of Size and Setting. This feature categorizes each degree into 20 different classes. (More information, its webpage shows details, <a href="http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/classification_descriptions/size_setting.php">Carnegieclassifications</a>.) </p>

<p>Carnegie Class 17 and 18 are Four-year, large, highly residential and Exclusively graduate/professional. These two shows better median earning than other classes. Moreover, there are not much of differences in median earning on other classes.</p>



<h2 class="section-heading">Feature Importance and Next Step</h2>

<p>I create a model to understand the relationship between variables. I use Gradient Boosting Regressor to build my model because  Gradient Boosting model gives me lowest RMSE, the residual average of $4887.38. From Feature importance, I realize that health major is the most important feature to predict median earning. Moreover, carnegie_undergrad 0.0 and highest degree are similar meanings, which is the graduate degree. </p>

<p>For next step, I want to know more details on meaning of each features. Especially, </p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>I use 2012 median earning data, but around 1000 target data are null values. To make accurate model, more data should be in website. </li>
  <li>Not just target data, but also many features are missing when I get data from Education Department API. To make accurate model, I need to have more data.</li>
  <li>2012 is five year ago. If I want to use today's median earning after college, I should consider other conditions as well such as inflation and job market status. </li>
  <li>I want to explore more features that influence on median earning of college graduated people.</li>
</ul>
